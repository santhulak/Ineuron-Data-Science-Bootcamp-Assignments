    "The float class is the built-in floating-point type in Python, and it is implemented in hardware in most modern processors. The float class is suitable for most general-purpose numerical calculations.  It can represent a wide range of numbers, including very large and very small values, and it supports a variety of mathematical operations. However, because of the way floating-point numbers are stored and processed, there can be rounding errors and loss of precision when performing calculations with them.\n",

    "The Decimal class, on the other hand, provides a higher level of precision and accuracy than the float class, as it stores numbers as decimal fractions rather than as binary fractions. This makes it more suitable for financial calculations and other applications that require exact decimal arithmetic. Decimal class can be slower and less efficient than the float class, and it may not support all the mathematical functions or operations that the float class does.Decimal class is better suited for applications that require exact decimal arithmetic and a higher level of precision and accuracy."
