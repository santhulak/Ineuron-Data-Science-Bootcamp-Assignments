    "Yes, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers. True random numbers are generated from physical sources of randomness, such as atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, or thermal noise, and they are truly unpredictable. Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated by deterministic algorithms that use a starting value called a seed. While the output of a good pseudo-random number generator appears to be random, it is actually deterministic, meaning that the same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers.\n",

    "The reason why pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" is that they can be used in many applications where true randomness is not necessary, such as simulations, games, and cryptography. Pseudo-random numbers can be generated quickly and efficiently, and their statistical properties can be analyzed to ensure that they behave like truly random numbers."
