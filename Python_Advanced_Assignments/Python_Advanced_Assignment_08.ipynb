If a handler is not found, the exception will propagate to the default exception handler and display a traceback. If a matching handler is found, its code block is executed and control returns to the point where the exception was raised."

However, this method has been deprecated because it is less informative and flexible than class-based exceptions. With string-based exceptions, there is no way to attach additional information to the exception, such as error codes or other attributes. Additionally, it is more difficult to catch specific exceptions because the handler must compare strings, which is not always reliable."
