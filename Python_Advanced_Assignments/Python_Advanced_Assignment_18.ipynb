This can cause compatibility issues when transferring or sharing files between different systems. Additionally, binary operations can be more difficult to read and interpret compared to text-based formats, which can make debugging and troubleshooting more challenging. Finally, binary operations can be more prone to errors and corruption if the file is not properly handled or if there are issues with data integrity."
