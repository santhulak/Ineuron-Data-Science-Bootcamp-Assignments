    "A metaclass is a class that defines the behavior of other classes. In other words, a metaclass is a class of a class. When we define a class in Python, we are actually creating an instance of a metaclass, which is used to create new objects of that class. Metaclasses are rarely used in day-to-day Python programming, but they can be useful in advanced applications that require dynamic class generation or customization. Examples of such applications include object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks, code generation tools, and advanced data processing frameworks.\n"

However, metaclasses have a broader scope of application, as they can be used to modify the way in which classes are defined, whereas class decorators can only modify the attributes of an existing class. Additionally, metaclasses are more complex to use than class decorators, as they require a deeper understanding of the Python object model."
