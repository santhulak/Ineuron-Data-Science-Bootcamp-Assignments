    "Memory efficiency: array objects are more memory efficient than lists, particularly when dealing with large datasets. This is because array stores data in a contiguous block of memory, whereas lists store references to objects scattered throughout memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster access: Because array elements are stored in a contiguous block of memory, accessing elements is faster than with a list, where accessing an element involves following a pointer to a different memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type enforcement: Since array can only store elements of the same type, it enforces type checking, which can help catch errors early and improve code reliability.\n",
