    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to enable users to create reusable and modular code through the use of classes and objects. OOP allows programmers to define classes, which are templates for creating objects that have similar properties and behaviors. These classes can contain attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. This approach makes it easier to write, maintain, and reuse code, as well as providing a way to encapsulate code and data into more manageable units. OOP in Python is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which provide further flexibility and modularity to the code."
