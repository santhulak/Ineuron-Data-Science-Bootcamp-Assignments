    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from more than one parent class. In other words, a subclass can have more than one superclass, and it inherits the attributes and methods of all its superclasses. Multiple inheritance can be useful for creating complex class hierarchies and for reusing code from multiple sources. "

In object-oriented programming, it is a design technique where a class is made up of objects of other classes, rather than inheriting functionality through inheritance relationships. Composition differs from inheritance in that it provides more dynamic relationships between objects, as the component objects can be modified or replaced at runtime."
